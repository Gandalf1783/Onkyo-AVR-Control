# Onkyo-AVR-Control
A java implementation to remotely control ONKYO AVRs over a local Network.

Currently in early development and non-functional. Come back later again to check it out. :)

Thanks for the document from Onkyo describing the protocol, including a full list of supported commands. (can be found in doc/)
